Just a simple to-do list creator. Tasks are objects that get initialized with a name, description, due date, and priority. They can be toggled as complete or incomplete with .complete(true/false)
It's a work in progress and probably not useful to anyone but I'm just trying to track me learning.

Just compile and execute. for now it's just g++ main.cpp Task.cpp
